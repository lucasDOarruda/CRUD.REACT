          I'm a front-end developer with a background in data analysis within the supply chain. I have a knack for spotting patterns and creating solutions to make processes smoother. Right now, I'm diving into the world of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), and it's super exciting! ðŸ˜„
          <br/><br/>
          In this EDI project, you'll find cool features like order tracking, bulk order requests, and an inventory table. We can easily import and export data, making things run like a charm. There's even more exciting stuff on the horizon, so stay tuned for updates!
          <br/><br/>
          I'd love to hear your feedback as we venture into this journey together. Thanks for joining in, and I hope you enjoy what we're building! ðŸš€
